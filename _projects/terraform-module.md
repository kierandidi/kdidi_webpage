# Terraform Module for EMR Serverless
We recently published a [Terraform module for EMR Serverless](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/kierandidi/emrserverless/aws/1.0.0) that came out of my internship at the [translational bioinformatics group](https://www.bioinformatics.csiro.au/) at CSIRO in Sydney.

With this module, we want to make it easier to use this relatively new service at AWS (released in June 2022) which we think is really useful for scalable and cost-effective big data analysis.
