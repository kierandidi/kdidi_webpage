## Conformational Entropy - A blessing and a curse


## How much truth is there in our structures, anyway?

## Credits

Thanks a lot to the organisers of the RosettaCon conference, both for making the conference a great experience and for allowing me to post this summary on their website and use their logo for the post on my website.
